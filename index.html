            <h2>Hello there!</h2>
            <p>I am a co-founder of an indie game studio, had been a technical lead for multiple software engineering teams, and am currently a Computer Science lecturer. I possess both entrepreneurial and technical experience to create highly robust and maintanable systems for software applications and video games.</p>
            <p>Now as an educator, I am eager to impart good "software craftmanship" - writing precise, functional code, while keeping an open-mind to new ways of doing things.</p>
            <p>I am also one of the creative minds behind <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/909820/Songbird_Symphony/">Songbird Symphony</a>, a cute lil' game published on Steam, Nintentdo Switch and Sony PlayStation.</p>
            <p>I keep a blog on programming, mathematics, video games and faith. I hope this site can become a learning resource for anyone interested.</p>
            <p>All opinions expressed in these writings are mine only and are not representative of my employers' views.</p>
